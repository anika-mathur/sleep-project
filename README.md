# sleep-project

## General Information
This project, created by Anika Mathur, explores sleep and the impact of stress, dreams, and the quality of hours slept every night. The data for this project comes from my own records- every morning, I filled out information about the previous night’s sleep: how many hours I slept, the quality of sleep (poor, good great), whether I was under stress that day(yes/no) and the presence of dreams (yes/no). This data was recorded from 4/19/24 - 6/7/24, and helps me get an insight on my sleep patterns and the factors that affect them. 

## Data and File Overview
The primary data set for this visualization was ‘es193ds_sleep_data.xlsx’ which records my sleep habits every night for over a month. Each row in this dataset is a different day, and there are columns for hours, quality, stress, and dreams.
